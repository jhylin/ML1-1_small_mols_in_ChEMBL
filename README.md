A series of Quarto markdown files (.qmd) are stored in this repository for an updated version of this old post on
"Small molecules in ChEMBL database - Series 1.1 - Polars dataframe library and machine learning in scikit-learn". This old post will be updated and splitted into smaller posts for ease of reading (and also to avoid draining my energy too quickly). After updating this first post of the series, I may also look at two other posts (basically series 1.2 & 1.3) to see if they can be changed as well. I'll attach .ipynb versions of each updated post when they're done.

As on 18/9/24:

* I'm slowly starting on the 3rd post where scikit-learn will be used after first two posts/drafts are completed (hopefully no more big changes)

* ETA: hopefully within the last quarter of the year for the first lot (i.e. ML 1-1-1 to 1-1-4) at least!
