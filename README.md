A series of Quarto markdown files (.qmd) are stored in this repository for an updated version of this old post on
"Small molecules in ChEMBL database - Series 1.1 - Polars dataframe library and machine learning in scikit-learn". This old post will be updated and splitted into smaller posts for ease of reading (and also to avoid draining my energy too quickly). After updating this first post of the series, I may also look at two other posts (basically series 1.2 & 1.3) to see if they can be changed as well. I'll attach .ipynb versions of each updated post when they're done.

So far (as on 5/9/24):

* I've managed to convert the old .csv file (~660MB) into a parquet file (currently under 100MB) that can be uploaded into the repository (previously I didn't even set up a repo for it so this might not be great)

* When I finish the draft of first parquet file post, I'll slowly move onto the next part attempting to use Polars only with Scikit_learn (previously Polars and Pandas were used together in the post) - this part may take longer

ETA: hopefully within the last quarter of the year!
