A series of Quarto markdown files (.qmd) are stored in this repository for an updated version of this old post on
"Small molecules in ChEMBL database - Series 1.1 - Polars dataframe library and machine learning in scikit-learn". This old post will be updated and splitted into smaller posts for ease of reading (and also to avoid draining my energy too quickly). After updating this first post of the series, I may also look at two other posts (basically series 1.2 & 1.3) to see if they can be changed as well. I'll attach .ipynb versions of each updated post when they're done.

So far as on 16/9/24:

* I've managed to convert the old .csv file (~660MB) into a parquet file (currently under 104MB) that can be uploaded into the repository (previously I didn't even set up a repo for this ML series so this might not be great)

* I'm updating the 2nd post now, and while doing so I'm also updating 1st post as I go... (there are two versions of 1st post but eventually there should just be one - working on it)

* ETA: hopefully within the last quarter of the year for the first lot (i.e. ML 1-1-1 to 1-1-4) at least!
